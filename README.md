# stripe-nodejs-experiment
My very simple experiment (unfinished) - trying Stripe's Node.js integration

Rough draft version - currently no error handling mechanisms (i.e. works fine with positive testing scenarios)

P.S. node_modules excluded from staging. Stripe's Node.js integration & MongoDB libraries should be installed in order for the program to run properly.
